    part


conventional2 : String

        part =
            """
            This multiline string
            has unexpected 12 spaces and newlines. ğŸ˜¢
            """

    part

conventional2
--> "\n            This multiline string\n            has unexpected 12 spaces and newlines. ğŸ˜¢\n            "
